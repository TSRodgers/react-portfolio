        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Tyler Rodgers, and I am an aspiring Full-Stack Developer. I attended Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, for four years. After numerous times of changing to various healthcare-related majors, I decided it was time to take a step back and genuinely figure out what I wanted to do. During this time, I have had several work roles ranging from line cook to yard manager of a commercial tire company. These experiences have brought me in contact with a wide range of people from vastly different backgrounds and have taught me how to work effectively under pressure and from all levels of the “totem pole.”
  
          Throughout my life, I’ve always been curious and a natural problem solver. At a young age, I expressed immense interest in computers but coming from a small town in North Carolina; the tech world was unknown to me. That is until I discovered the world of opportunities that the tech industry has to offer and decided to take the jump. I ultimately cast the idea of working with computers aside as a dream or hobby and continued down the path I had chosen for myself. 
  
          Excited by the possibilities and challenges offered by this industry, I enrolled in UNC-Chapel Hill’s Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, and I couldn’t be happier with the decision I made. With graduation drawing closer, the possibility of building the career I’ve always dreamed of, where I am continuously challenged and pushed to learn and grow, seems palpable.
